Eloquentity is a powerful package that seamlessly integrates Eloquent models with the concept of entities in your Laravel application. 

It allows you to effortlessly map your existing Eloquent models to entity objects, providing a more object-oriented approach to handling data. 

With Eloquentity, any changes made to these entity objects can be easily persisted back to the database, preserving the integrity of your data and associated relationships. 

Additionally, Eloquentity empowers you to create and persist entirely new entities, streamlining the process of working with complex data structures. 

By bridging the gap between the object-oriented paradigm and the database layer, Eloquentity enhances code organization, maintainability, and overall development efficiency within your Laravel projects.
